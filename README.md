# SQL Final Project
## Introduction
This projdct aims to investigate the buisnesses profile and user profile on Yelp for sentiment analysis. The project first investigate the busineesses from food category in Toronto with high rating and low rating. By comparing the buisnesses, the project discovered that the ones with high rating usually have longer openning hour and more customer reviews, while no obvios trend in the neighborhood. The project then continued to look into the user profiles to compare the users with most fans and least fans in order to investigate the factors that contribute the fans number of the Yelp users. The popular users are the ones with more than 100 fans, while the unpopular users are the ones without any fans. The popular users tend to be on yelp for a longer period of time, and they have posted a lot of reviews that tend to receive more feedbacks as being ‘useful’, ‘funny’ and ‘cool’. When looking at the stars, there doesn’t seem to be a difference. In other words, the stars coming from the users won’t affect their popularity. This project allows Yelp to understand the user and business culture that allows them to be popular on Yelp.
